# CESM Analytics

This project creates a novel database and calculates usage metrics for CESM2, a climate model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This work began under a summer internship through the Summer Internships in Parallel Computing Science (SIParCS) in 2019 by me, Lolita Mannik. This repo was created as a place to share, manage, and continue the project as a thesis required to complete my master's degree in data science from Regis University in Denver. 

Iâ€™d like to specifically demonstrate database skills, data cleaning, and statistical and machine learning methods. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  

### Built With

* [Python 3.7 version from Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) - Programming language
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) - IDE for Python
* This project was run on Windows 10.

## Prerequisites
Once Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed, the following Python packages are required:

* sqlalchemy 
* json
* pandas
* datetime

* numpy 
* scipy.stats
* statsmodels.api

* matplotlib.pyplot 
* seaborn 
* pylab
* plotly.express


## File Descriptions
**Practicum Proposal** - A complete description of the background for the project and week-by-week outline of steps.
**Data Dictionary** - Dictionary of features parsed from CESM timing files.
**sample_timing_file** - Look at an original .txt file before it's been parsed.
**cmip_09_10_2019.json** - JSON file containing 6088 timing files from CMIP6 experiments: July 20, 2018 through September 20, 2019.
**CESM JSON to SQL + Outlier Detection Thesis1.ipynb** - Jupyter Notebook (Python) that takes the cmip_09_10_2019.json file, converts to a Pandas dataframe, sets datatypes, removes outliers, and saves the results as df_NoOutlier-Thesis.csv.
**df-NoOutlier-Thesis.csv** - Data file used in CESM Upgrade Analysis Thesis 1.ipynb and ATM Component Analysis Thesis 1.ipynb.
**CESM Upgrade Analysis Thesis 1.ipynb** - Using df_NoOutlier-Thesis.csv created from the CESM JSON to SQL + Outlier Detection Thesis1 notebook, this Jupyter Notebook establishes basic metrics for CMIP6 experiments on CESM2 and analyzes the performance (model cost) of cases and ensembles before and after a system upgrade on the Cheyenne supercomputer. Among overall model cost, normalized model cost, or model cost by individual case or ensemble, none of the data was normal according to KS and Shapiro_Wilk tests. Performance degradation (5 to 28%) is correlated with the highest count of atmospheric processors (3,456 processors) for cases that span the upgrade, however, performance improvement (11 to 20%) is found in cases with 1,800 atmospheric processors. Testing for statistical significance (Kruskal-Wallis) on before/after upgrade performance was also calculated on cases and ensembles that span the upgrade.
**ATM Component Analysis Thesis 1.ipynb** - Using df_NoOutlier-Thesis.csv, this Jupyter Notebook analyzes the performance (model cost) of the atmospheric component before and after a system upgrade on the Cheyenne supercomputer. Groups of matching atmospheric component, atmospheric processor count and oceanic processor count are created and analyzed before and after the upgrade. The same testing for normality, performance changes, and statistical significance is performed as in the previous notebook. Again, performance degradation (2 to 19%) for groups with 3,456 atmospheric processors is found. In this analysis, performance degradation (4%) also occured in groups with 1,800 atmospheric processors, although performance improvement (5%) was found in groups with 1080 atmospheric processors.
