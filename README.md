# CESM Analytics

This project creates a novel database and calculates usage metrics for CESM, a climate model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This work began under a summer internship through the Summer Internships in Parallel Computing Science (SIParCS) in 2019 by me, Lolita Mannik. This repo was created as a place to share, manage, and continue the project as a thesis required to complete my master's degree in data science from Regis University in Denver. 

Iâ€™d like to specifically showcase database skills, data cleaning, and statistical and machine learning methods. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Built With

* [Python 3.7 version from Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) - Programming language
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) - IDE for Python
* This project was run on Windows 10.

## Directory of Repo Files
* Practicum Proposal. A complete description of the background for the project and week-byweek outline of steps.
* Data Dictionary. Dictionary of features parsed from CESM timing files.
* sample_timing_file. Look at an original .txt file before it's been parsed.


Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running Jupyter Notebooks

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
